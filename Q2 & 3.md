## Q2: A is the major exchange, while B is the minor exchange. Trade price reported from B may correlate with the trade price reported from A. Please describe a framework to analyze such correlation (no coding needed).

The framework would combine EDA, correlation analysis, statistical modeling, and advanced techniques to analyze and understand the relationship between trade prices from Exchange A and Exchange B.

### 1. Data Collection and Preparation

-   **Data Collection**: Gather trade data from both exchanges, including timestamps, trade prices, and trade sizes.
-   **Data Cleaning**: Remove erroneous records and ensure data consistency.
-   **Time Alignment**: Synchronize timestamps to a common timeline, adjusting for known time lags.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

-   **Descriptive Statistics**: Compute basic statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) for trade prices from both exchanges.
-   **Visualization**: Create time series plots for trade prices to inspect patterns and trends.
-   **Lag Analysis**: Determine the time lag by identifying the shift needed for maximum correlation.

### 3. Correlation Analysis

-   **Pearson Correlation**: Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient to measure the linear relationship.
-   **Cross-Correlation Function (CCF)**: Analyze how correlation changes with different lags.
-   **Rolling Correlation**: Compute correlation over rolling windows to observe temporal changes.

### 4. Statistical Modeling

-   **Linear Regression**: Model the relationship between trade prices from both exchanges:
    \[
    \text{Price}\_B = \alpha + \beta \cdot \text{Price}\_A + \epsilon
    \]
-   **Granger Causality Test**: Determine if prices from Exchange A can forecast prices from Exchange B.

### 5. Evaluation and Validation

-   **Out-of-Sample Testing**: Validate models using out-of-sample data.
-   **Backtesting**: Evaluate historical performance of the models in predicting minor exchange prices.

## Q3 (open question): The time lag and price correlation between exchanges are not uncommon in real trading. Think about how to avoid being taken advantage by other traders when you send out orders to multiple exchanges.

To avoid being taken advantage of due to time lag and price correlation between exchanges, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Smart Order Routing (SOR)

-   **Algorithmic Trading**: Use advanced algorithms to route orders across multiple exchanges based on real-time market conditions, dynamically adjusting to achieve the best execution price and minimize exposure to time lag.
-   **Latency Optimization**: Optimize network connections and co-locate trading servers near exchange data centers to reduce latency.

### 2. Use of Dark Pools

-   **Private Exchanges**: Execute large orders in dark pools where order details are not visible to the public market, reducing the risk of information leakage and front-running by other traders.
-   **Order Splitting**: Split large orders into smaller chunks and execute them across different exchanges and dark pools to minimize market impact and detection.

### 3. Real-Time Monitoring and Adaptation

-   **Market Surveillance**: Continuously monitor market conditions and adapt trading strategies in real-time to respond to anomalies or arbitrage opportunities.
-   **Dynamic Hedging**: Implement dynamic hedging strategies to protect against adverse price movements and exploit time lags between exchanges.

These strategies help minimize risks and ensure fairer and more efficient trade executions.

Q2: A is the major exchange, while B is the minor exchange. Trade
price reported from B may correlate with the trade price reported from
A. Please describe a framework to analyze such correlation (no coding
needed).

Q3 (open question): The time lag and price correlation between
exchanges are not uncommon in real trading. Think about how to avoid
being taken advantage by other traders when you send out orders to
multiple exchanges.
